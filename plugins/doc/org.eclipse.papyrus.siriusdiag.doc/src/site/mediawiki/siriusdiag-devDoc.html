		<h1 id="Sirius_viewpoint">Sirius viewpoint</h1>
		<p>Each new diagram contribution is added in a new plugin, which contains the description of the mapping, the filters and the tools available for this diagram.</p>
		<p>For more information about viewpoint description, you can have a look at the sirius documentation available here:

			<a href="https://www.eclipse.org/sirius/doc/specifier/general/Specifying_Viewpoints.html">https://www.eclipse.org/sirius/doc/specifier/general/Specifying_Viewpoints.html</a>
		</p>
		<p>Note that each viewpoint shall reuse:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The common layer which is a mandatory layer defining the common concept of all diagrams (Hyperlink and Benpoint).</li>
			<li>The common tool, for navigation, deletion, etc.</li>
			<li>Common and specific java services. </li>
		</ul>
		<h1 id="Adding_a_new_diagram_to_the_architecture_file">Adding a new diagram to the architecture file</h1>
		<p>The editor provided to edit the DocumentStructureTemplate metamodel is not exactly the version generated by EMF. We customized it in order to use a TransactionalEditingDomain (to ease the Papyrus integration). </p>
		<p>When we add a new Sirius diagram, we shall create a new Sirius diagram prototype:</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="../../../image/dev/1_ViewCreation.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>Once the Sirius Diagram Prototype has been created, it shall be defined as in the following picture:</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="../../../image/dev/5_DefineRepresentation.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>To be able to reference the corresponding Diagram Description, it shall first be loaded in order to reference it. This can be done as in the following image:</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="../../../image/dev/2_LoadViewpoint.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>And select the corresponding *.odesign file using the Browse Workspace:</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="../../../image/dev/2_SelectOdesign.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>Once the Sirius Diagram Prototype has been created. We shall select on which viewpoint this representation shall be allowed. To do this, select the viewpoint and add a Representation Kinds:</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="../../../image/dev/4_AddRespresentation.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>And simply select the diagram prototype that was created on the previous step.</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="../../../image/dev/3_RegisterRepresentation.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>This shall be done for both Analysis and Design viewpoint.</p>
		<h2 id="Adding_the_creation_command">Adding the creation command</h2>
		<p>In the org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.siriusdiag.representation.architecture plugin, a new class extending the AbstractCreateSiriusDiagramEditorCommand shall be created. This class will manage the condition of the creation of the diagram and the action to execute before creating it depending on the context.</p>
		<p>For example, a sequence diagram can be created directly under an interaction without prior action, but if we want to create it under a Model, an interaction shall be created before and defined as the root of the diagram.</p>
		<h1 id="Sirius_session_management">Sirius session management</h1>
		<p>To use the same transactional editing domain than other papyrus services, we had to override the default sirius session and creation. This is done by the PapyrusSessionFactory which allows to create PapyrusSession (which are just sirius session with the right TransactionalEditingDomain).</p>
		<p>For new services using session, it is recommanded to use the SessionService provided in the org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.siriusdiag.ui plugin. </p>
		<h1 id="Common_Diagram">Common Diagram</h1>
		<h2 id="Common_concepts">Common concepts</h2>
		<h3 id="Bendpoints">Bendpoints</h3>
		<p>Benpoints mapping is used to draw a Benpoint node at the intersection of edges when the Benpoints filter is activated.</p>
		<h3 id="Hyperlink">Hyperlink</h3>
		<p>Hyperlink node is used to add a node in the diagram that allows to navigate to other representation.</p>
		<h3 id="Refresh_provider">Refresh provider</h3>
		<p>In some sirius diagrams, for several purpose (region management, bendpoints and sequence diagram reorder), the post refresh behavior of sirius diagrams have been overriden.</p>
		<p>To override this behavior, we have used the following extension point org.eclipse.sirius.refreshExtensionProvider.</p>
		<h3 id="Common_services">Common services</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>PapyrusSiriusTabbarContributor allows to enable or deactivate tools in the sirius tabbar.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="../../../image/dev/6_SiriusTabbar.png"/>
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>AbstractDiagramServices is used to manage Label node label, node creation and node drag and drop tools.</li>
