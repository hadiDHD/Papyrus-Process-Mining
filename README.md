# MER for Papyrus

This is the adaptation of the MER process mining plugin (https://github.com/hadiDHD/ProcessMining) to capture event traces in the Papyrus modeling editor.
It uses another repo that integrates Sirius Diagrams into a Papyrus context (https://git.eclipse.org/c/papyrus/org.eclipse.papyrus-sirius.git)
