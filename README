# Papyrus Process Mining

This is the adaptation of the process mining plugin (https://github.com/hadiDHD/ProcessMining) to capture event traces in Papyrus modeling editor.
It uses another repo which integrates Sirius Diagrams into a Papyrus context (https://git.eclipse.org/r/papyrus/org.eclipse.papyrus-sirius.git)
